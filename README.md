## Introduction

Ajikri is a web application designed to help users list and browse rental ads for various items such as vehicles (cars, motorcycles, trucks, quad bikes, jet skis), real estate, and clothes. Users looking to rent items can either browse ads without registering or create their own rental ads after signing up. All transactions and bookings are handled externally between users.
